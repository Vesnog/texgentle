When TEX is reading the text to be typeset from your input file, it reads in a paragraph
at a time and then typesets it. This means that there is a lot of control over paragraph
shapes, but also that some care must be taken. We’ve already seen that  hsize can be used
to control the width of a single paragraph. But suppose the following appeared as part of
your input file:

\hsize = 10 cm

The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words.

\rightskip = 1.75 in
Everyone realizes why a new common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators. To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words.

her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli,
